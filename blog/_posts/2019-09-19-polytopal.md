Introducing <a href="https://polytopal.ai">Polytopal</a>

As industries transition to AI-centric products and operations, organizations waste months to years in miscommunication between design, engineering, and business. Most businesses will fail to make this transition entirely. Moreover, given the complexity of AI, problems often don’t manifest until the systems are online and learning in real-time. Our team speaks the language of design and engineering, and we know not only what makes good products, but also how to leverage AI technology intelligently and effectively. We’ve worked with deep learning tools as diverse as voice assistants, recommender systems, computer vision, and natural language processing, not to mention our experience with traditional ML algorithms that are already pervasive across industries and use cases.

Polytopal is a design firm built for an AI-powered future. Founded by Abhay Agarwal, Polytopal helps organizations build scalable AI solutions that solve business challenges and address real human needs. Our lens is human-centered design, which we merge with real-world experience in building AI-based products and services. We stand in good company with clients that include Spotify and Fidelity, and our services range from product design, UI/UX, and engineering services to help you both define and deliver value to your stakeholders.
