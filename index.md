  A course at the Stanford d.School on the intersection of Design
  and ML (machine learning) that is offered in the Winter quarter
  of 2018-2019
---

Designing Machine Learning is a project by the [Stanford d.School] to make Machine Learning (ML) more accessible to innovators from all disciplines. We believe that ML will soon be a widespread feature of products, services, systems, and experiences in all walks of life. In order to make this computational revolution possible, as well as to ensure that it closely follows human values, we must empower a new generation of professionals to incorporate ML into their creative process.

## Motivation
Design is the exploration of possibility, at once a critique of the present and a supreme optimism about human ingenuity. In a way, machines are design made manifest. Machines are programmable constructs, giving limitless potential and new forms of agency to the designer. Machine learning is yet another axis of empowerment, still incipient in its capabilities. Perhaps it is the humility with which we have previously approached machine learning that has prevented us from applying it pervasively, or exposing it to wider inquiry.

Traditionally, designers have differed from data scientists in their approach to building systems and their metrics of measuring success. At its core, this is a difference of _values_ that pervades each field. Data science is statistical and numerical, with focus placed on standardized measures, such as "training versus test accuracy". To designers, this (and many other) metrics are essentially arbitrary. What matters to designers is the human value ascribed to the experience of the product. How do we reconcile this stark contrast?
